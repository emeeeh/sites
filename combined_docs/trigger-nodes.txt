Telegram Trigger node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Stuck waiting for trigger event # When testing the Telegram Trigger node with the Test step or or Test workflow buttons, the execution may appear stuck and unable to stop listening for events. If this occurs, you may need to exit the workflow and open it again to reset the canvas. Stuck listening events often occur due to issues with your network configuration outside of n8n. Specifically, this behavior often occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy without configuring websocket proxying. To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support. Bad request: bad webhook: An HTTPS URL must be provided for webhook # This error occurs when you run n8n behind a reverse proxy and there is a problem with your instance's webhook URL. When running n8n behind a reverse proxy, you must configure the WEBHOOK_URL environment variable with the public URL where your n8n instance is running. For Telegram, this URL must use HTTPS. To fix this issue, configure TLS/SSL termination in your reverse proxy. Afterward, update your WEBHOOK_URL environment variable to use the HTTPS address. Workflow only works in testing or production # Telegram only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that every time you switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa), Telegram overwrites the registered webhook URL. You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. The Telegram bot will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications. To work around this, you can either disable your workflow when testing or create separate Telegram bots for testing and production. To create a separate telegram bot for testing, repeat the process you completed to create your first bot. Reference Telegram's bot documentation and the Telegram bot API reference for more information. To disable your workflow when testing, try the following: Halts production traffic This workaround temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated. Go to your workflow page. Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL. When you finish testing, toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working.

To resolve: For OAuth2 credentials, make sure you've enabled the Google Drive API in APIs & Services > Library . Refer to Google OAuth2 Single Service - Enable APIs for more information. For Service Account credentials: Enable domain-wide delegation . Make sure you add the Google Drive API as part of the domain-wide delegation configuration. Handling more than one file change # The Google Drive Trigger node polls Google Drive for changes at a set interval (once every minute by default). If multiple changes to the Watch For criteria occur during the polling interval, a single Google Drive Trigger event occurs containing the changes as items. To handle this, your workflow must account for times when the data might contain more than one item. You can use an if node or a switch node to change your workflow's behavior depending on whether the data from the Google Drive Trigger node contains a single item or multiple items.

To resolve this issue, check your reverse proxy configuration (Nginx, Caddy, Apache HTTP Server, Traefik, etc.) to enable websocket support. Date and time columns are rendering as numbers # Google Sheets can render dates and times a few different ways. The serial number format , popularized by Lotus 1-2-3 and used my types of spreadsheet software, represents dates as a decimal number. The whole number component (the part left of the decimal) represents the number of days since December 30, 1899. The decimal portion (the part right of the decimal) represents time as a portion of a 24-hour period (for example, .5 represents noon). To use a different format for date and time values, adjust the format in your Google Sheet Trigger node. This is available when Trigger On is set to Row Added : Open the Google Sheet Trigger node on your canvas. Select Add option . Select DateTime Render . Change DateTime Render to Formatted String . The Google Sheets Trigger node will now format date, time, datetime, and duration fields as strings according to their number format. The number format depends on the spreadsheet's locale settings. You can change the local by opening the spreadsheet and selecting File > Settings . In the General tab, set Locale to your preferred locale. Select Save settings to adjust the value.

On this page, you'll find a list of events the Slack Trigger node can respond to and links to more resources. Credentials You can find authentication information for this node here . Examples and templates For usage examples and templates to help you get started, refer to n8n's Slack integrations page. Events # Any Event : The node triggers on any event in Slack. Bot / App Mention : The node triggers when your bot or app is mentioned in a channel the app is in. File Made Public : The node triggers when a file is made public . File Shared : The node triggers when a file is shared in a channel the app is in. New Message Posted to Channel : The node triggers when a new message is posted to a channel the app is in. New Public Channel Created : The node triggers when a new public channel is created. New User : The node triggers when a new user is added to Slack. Reaction Added : The node triggers when a reaction is added to a message the app is added to. Parameters # Once you've set the events to trigger on, use the remaining parameters to further define the node's behavior: Watch Whole Workspace : Whether the node should watch for the selected Events in all channels in the workspace (turned on) or not (turned off, default). Caution This will use one execution for every event in any channel your bot or app is in. Use with caution! Channel to Watch : Select the channel your node should watch for the selected Events . This parameter only appears if you don't turn on Watch Whole Workspace . You can select a channel: From list : The node uses your credential to look up a list of channels in the workspace so you can select the channel you want. By ID : Enter the ID of a channel you want to watch. Slack displays the channel ID at the bottom of the channel details with a one-click copy button. By URL : Enter the URL of the channel you want to watch, formatted as https://app.slack.com/client/<channel-address> .

Usernames or IDs to ignore : Select usernames or enter a comma-separated string of encoded user IDs to ignore events from. Choose from the list, or specify IDs using an expression . Related resources # n8n provides an app node for Slack. You can find the node docs here . View example workflows and related content on n8n's website. Refer to Slack's documentation for details about their API. Required scopes # To use this node, you need to create an application in Slack and enable event subscriptions. Refer to Slack credentials | Slack Trigger configuration for more information. You must add the appropriate scopes to your Slack app for this trigger node to work. The node requires scopes for the conversations.list and users.list methods at minimum. Check out the Scopes | Slack credentials list for a more complete list of scopes. Common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Slack Trigger node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Workflow only works in testing or production # Slack only allows you to register a single webhook per app. This means that you can't switch from using the testing URL to the production URL (and vice versa) without reconfiguring the registered webhook URL. You may have trouble with this if you try to test a workflow that's also active in production. Slack will only send events to one of the two webhook URLs, so the other will never receive event notifications. To work around this, you can disable your workflow when testing: Halts production traffic This temporarily disables your production workflow for testing. Your workflow will no longer receive production traffic while it's deactivated. Go to your workflow page. Toggle the Active switch in the top panel to disable the workflow temporarily. Edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the testing webhook URL instead of the production webhook URL. Test your workflow using the test webhook URL. When you finish testing, edit the Request URL in your the Slack Trigger configuration to use the production webhook URL instead of the testing webhook URL. Toggle the Inactive toggle to enable the workflow again. The production webhook URL should resume working. Token expired # Slack offers token rotation that you can turn on for bot and user tokens. This makes every tokens expire after 12 hours. While this may be useful for testing, n8n credentials using tokens with this enabled will fail after expiry. If you want to use your Slack credentials in production, this feature must be off . To check if your Slack app has token rotation turned on, refer to the Slack API Documentation | Token Rotation . If your app uses token rotation Please note, if your Slack app uses token rotation, you can't turn it off again. You need to create a new Slack app with token rotation disabled instead.
