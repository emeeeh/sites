OpenAI Assistant operations # Use this operation to create, delete, list, message, or update an assistant in OpenAI. Refer to OpenAI for more information on the OpenAI node itself. Create an Assistant # Use this operation to create a new assistant. Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with : Create or select an existing OpenAI credential . Resource : Select Assistant . Operation : Select Create an Assistant . Model : Select the model that the assistant will use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try gpt-4o if you need high intelligence or gpt-4o-mini if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to Models overview | OpenAI Platform for more information. Name : Enter the name of the assistant. The maximum length is 256 characters. Description : Enter the description of the assistant. The maximum length is 512 characters. 1 A virtual assistant that helps users with daily tasks, including setting reminders, answering general questions, and providing quick information. Instructions : Enter the system instructions that the assistant uses. The maximum length is 32,768 characters. Use this to specify the persona used by the model in its replies. 1 Always respond in a friendly and engaging manner. When a user asks a question, provide a concise answer first, followed by a brief explanation or additional context if necessary. If the question is open-ended, offer a suggestion or ask a clarifying question to guide the conversation. Keep the tone positive and supportive, and avoid technical jargon unless specifically requested by the user. Code Interpreter : Turn on to enable the code interpreter for the assistant, where it can write and execute code in a sandbox environment. Enable this tool for tasks that require computations, data analysis, or any logic-based processing. Knowledge Retrieval : Turn on to enable knowledge retrieval for the assistant, allowing it to access external sources or a connected knowledge base. Refer to File Search | OpenAI Platform for more information. Files : Select a file to upload for your external knowledge source. Use Upload a File operation to add more files. Options # Output Randomness (Temperature) : Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between 0.0 (deterministic) and 1.0 (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Top P) but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to 1.0 . Output Randomness (Top P) : Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, 0.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Temperature) but not both. Defaults to 1.0 . Fail if Assistant Already Exists : If enabled, the operation will fail if an assistant with the same name already exists. Refer to Create assistant | OpenAI documentation for more information. Delete an Assistant # Use this operation to delete an existing assistant from your account. Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with : Create or select an existing OpenAI credential . Resource : Select Assistant . Operation : Select Delete an Assistant . Assistant : Select the assistant you want to delete From list or By ID .

Telegram node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Add a bot to a Telegram channel # For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel . To add a bot to a channel: In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name. Label the channel name as public channel . Select Administrators > Add Admin . Search for the bot's username and select it. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel. Get the Chat ID # You can only use @channelusername on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID. There are three ways to get that ID: From the Telegram Trigger: Use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a - when you enter it in n8n. Invite Telegram's @RawDataBot to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a chat object. The id for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group. Send more than 30 messages per second # The Telegram API has a limitation of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages: Loop Over Items node : Use the Loop Over Items node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database. Telegram node : Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the Expression Editor to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node. Code node : Connect the Code node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node. You can also use this workflow . Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages # If you're using the node to send Telegram messages , the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end: This message was sent automatically with n8n To remove this attribution: In the node's Additional Fields section, select Add Field . Select Append n8n attribution . Turn the toggle off. Refer to Send Message additional fields for more information. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Discord node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Discord node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Add extra fields to embeds # Discord messages can optionally include embeds, a rich preview component that can include a title, description, image, link, and more. The Discord node supports embeds when using the Send operation on the Message resource. Select Add Embeds to set extra fields including Description, Author, Title, URL, and URL Image. To add fields that aren't included by default, set Input Method to Raw JSON . From here, add a JSON object to the Value parameter defining the field names and values you want to include. For example, to include footer and fields , neither of which are available using the Enter Fields Input Method, you could use a JSON object like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 { "author" : "My Name" , "url" : "https://discord.js.org" , "fields" : [ { "name" : "Regular field title" , "value" : "Some value here" } ], "footer" : { "text" : "Some footer text here" , "icon_url" : "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png" } } You can learn more about embeds in Using Webhooks and Embeds | Discord . If you experience issues when working with embeds with the Discord node, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Discord credentials to POST to the following URL: 1 https://discord.com/api/v10/channels/<CHANNEL_ID>/messages In the body, include your embed information in the message content like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 { "content" : "Test" , "embeds" : [ { "author" : "My Name" , "url" : "https://discord.js.org" , "fields" : [ { "name" : "Regular field title" , "value" : "Some value here" } ], "footer" : { "text" : "Some footer text here" , "icon_url" : "https://i.imgur.com/AfFp7pu.png" } } ] } Mention users and channels # To mention users and channels in Discord messages, you need to format your message according to Discord's message formatting guidelines . To mention a user, you need to know the Discord user's user ID. Keep in mind that the user ID is different from the user's display name. Similarly, you need a channel ID to link to a specific channel. You can learn how to enable developer mode and copy the user or channel IDs in Discord's documentation on finding User/Server/Message IDs . Once you have the user or channel ID, you can format your message with the following syntax: User : <@USER_ID> Channel : <#CHANNEL_ID> Role : <@&ROLE_ID> Was this page helpful?

MySQL node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the MySQL node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Update rows by composite key # The MySQL node's Update operation lets you to update rows in a table by providing a Column to Match On and a value. This works for tables where single column values can uniquely identify individual rows. You can't use this pattern for tables that use composite keys , where you need multiple columns to uniquely identify a row. A example of this is MySQL's user table in the mysql database, where you need both the user and host columns to uniquely identify rows. To update tables with composite keys, write the query manually with the Execute SQL operation instead. There, you can match on multiple values, like in this example which matches on both customer_id and product_id : 1 UPDATE orders SET quantity = 3 WHERE customer_id = 538 AND product_id = 800 ; Can't connect to a local MySQL server when using Docker # When you run either n8n or MySQL in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to MySQL. The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components. If only MySQL is in Docker # If only MySQL is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). When running the container, publish the port with the -p flag. By default, MySQL runs on port 3306, so your Docker command should look like this: 1 docker run -p 3306 :3306 --name my-mysql -d mysql:latest When configuring MySQL credentials , the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost ). If only n8n is in Docker # If only n8n is running in Docker, configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 on the host. If you are running n8n in Docker on Linux , use the --add-host flag to map host.docker.internal to host-gateway when you start the container. For example: 1 docker run -it --rm --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway --name n8n -p 5678 :5678 -v n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n docker.n8n.io/n8nio/n8n If you are using Docker Desktop, this is automatically configured for you. When configuring MySQL credentials , use host.docker.internal as the Host address instead of localhost . If MySQL and n8n are running in separate Docker containers # If both n8n and MySQL are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them. Configure MySQL to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official images are already configured this way). Add both the MySQL and n8n containers to the same user-defined bridge network . When configuring MySQL credentials , use the MySQL container's name as the host address instead of localhost . For example, if you call the MySQL container my-mysql , you would set the Host to my-mysql . If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container # If MySQL and n8n are running in the same Docker container, the localhost address doesn't need any special configuration. You can configure MySQL to listen on localhost and configure the Host in the MySQL credentials in n8n to use localhost . Decimal numbers returned as strings # By default, the MySQL node returns DECIMAL values as strings. This is done intentionally to avoid loss of precision that can occur due to limitation with the way JavaScript represents numbers. You can learn more about the decision in the documentation for the MySQL library that n8n uses. To output decimal values as numbers instead of strings and ignore the risks in loss of precision, enable the Output Decimals as Numbers option. This will output the values as numbers instead of strings. As an alternative, you can manually convert from the string to a decimal using the toFloat() function with toFixed() or with the Edit Fields (Set) node after the MySQL node. Be aware that you may still need to account for a potential loss of precision. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Telegram node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Add a bot to a Telegram channel # For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel . To add a bot to a channel: In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name. Label the channel name as public channel . Select Administrators > Add Admin . Search for the bot's username and select it. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel. Get the Chat ID # You can only use @channelusername on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID. There are three ways to get that ID: From the Telegram Trigger: Use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a - when you enter it in n8n. Invite Telegram's @RawDataBot to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a chat object. The id for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group. Send more than 30 messages per second # The Telegram API has a limitation of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages: Loop Over Items node : Use the Loop Over Items node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database. Telegram node : Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the Expression Editor to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node. Code node : Connect the Code node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node. You can also use this workflow . Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages # If you're using the node to send Telegram messages , the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end: This message was sent automatically with n8n To remove this attribution: In the node's Additional Fields section, select Add Field . Select Append n8n attribution . Turn the toggle off. Refer to Send Message additional fields for more information. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

WhatsApp Business Cloud node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the WhatsApp Business Cloud node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Bad request - please check your parameters # This error occurs when WhatsApp Business Cloud rejects your request because of a problem with its parameters. It's common to see this when using the Send Template operation if the data you send doesn't match the format of your template. To resolve this issue, review the parameters in your message template . Pay attention to each parameter's data type and the order they're defined in the template. Check the data that n8n is mapping to the template parameters. If you're using expressions to set parameter values, check the input data to make sure each item resolves to a valid value. You may want to use the Edit Fields (Set) node or set a fallback value to ensure you send a value with the correct format. Working with non-text media # The WhatsApp Business Cloud node can work with non-text messages and media like images, audio, documents, and more. If your operation includes a Input Data Field Name or Property Name parameter, set this to the field name itself rather than referencing the data in an expression. For example, if you are trying to send a message with an "Image" MessageType and Take Image From set to "n8n", set Input Data Field Name to a field name like data instead of an expression like {{ $json.input.data }} .

Supabase node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Supabase node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Filtering rows by metadata # To filter rows by Supabase metadata , set the Select Type to String . From there, you can construct a query in the Filters (String) parameter to filter the metadata using the Supabase metadata query language , inspired by the MongoDB selectors format. Access the metadata properties using the Postgres ->> arrow JSON operator like this (curly brackets denote components to fill in): 1 metadata->>{your-property}={comparison-operator}.{comparison-value} For example to access an age property in the metadata and return results greater than or equal to 21, you could enter the following in the Filters (String) field: 1 metadata->>age=gte.21 You can combine these operators to construct more complex queries. Can't connect to a local Supabase database when using Docker # When you run Supabase in Docker, you need to configure the network so that n8n can connect to Supabase. The solution depends on how you're hosting the two components. If only Supabase is in Docker # If only Supabase is running in Docker, the Docker Compose file used by the self-hosting guide already runs Supabase bound to the correct interfaces. When configuring Supabase credentials , the localhost address should work without a problem (set the Host to localhost ). If Supabase and n8n are running in separate Docker containers # If both n8n and Supabase are running in Docker in separate containers, you can use Docker networking to connect them. Configure Supabase to listen on all interfaces by binding to 0.0.0.0 inside of the container (the official Docker compose configuration already does this this). Add both the Supabase and n8n components to the same user-defined bridge network if you aren't already managing them together in the same Docker Compose file. When configuring Supabase credentials , use the Supabase API gateway container's name ( supabase-kong by default) as the host address instead of localhost . For example, if you use the default configuration, you would set the Host to http://supabase-kong:8000 . Records are accessible through Postgres but not Supabase # If queries for records return empty using the Supabase node, but are available through the Postgres node or with a Postgres client, there may be a conflict with Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) policy. Supabase always enables RLS when you create a table in a public schema with the Table Editor. When RLS is active, the API doesn't return any data with the public anon key until you create policies. This is a security measure to ensure that you only expose data you intend to. To access data from a table with RLS enabled as the anon role, create a policy to enable the access patterns you intend to use. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Notion node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Notion node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Relation property not displaying # The Notion node only supports displaying the data relation property for two-way relations . When you connect two Notion databases with a two-way relationship, you can select or filter by the relation property when working with the Notion node's Database Page resource. To enable two-way relations, edit the relation property in Notion and enable the Show on [name of related database] option to create a reverse relation. Select a name to use for the relation in the new context. The relation is now accessible in n8n when filtering or selecting. If you need to work with Notion databases with one-way relationship, you can use the HTTP Request with your existing Notion credentials. For example, to update a one-way relationship, you can send a PATCH request to the following URL: 1 https://api.notion.com/v1/pages/<page_id> Enable Send Body , set the Body Content Type to JSON , and set Specify Body to Using JSON . Afterward, you can enter a JSON object like the following into the JSON field: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 { "properties" : { "Account" : { "relation" : [ { "id" : "<your_relation_ID>" } ] } } } Create toggle heading # The Notion node allows you to create headings and toggles when adding blocks to Page , Database Page , or Block resources. Creating toggleable headings isn't yet supported by the Notion node itself. You can work around this be creating a regular heading and then modifying it to enable the is_toggleable property : Add a heading with Notion node. Select the resource you want to add a heading to: To add a new page with a heading, select the Page or Database Page resources with the Create operation. To add a heading to an existing page, select the Block resource with the Append After operation. Select Add Block and set the Type Name or ID to either Heading 1 , Heading 2 , or Heading 3 . Add an HTTP Request node connected to the Notion node and select the GET method. Set the URL to https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/<block_ID> . For example, if your added the heading to an existing page, you could use the following URL: https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.results[0].id }} . If you created a new page instead of appending a block, you may need to discover the block ID by querying the page contents first. Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials. Add an Edit Fields (Set) node after the HTTP Request node. Add heading_1.is_toggleable as a new Boolean field set to true . Swap heading_1 for a different heading number as necessary. Add a second HTTP Request node after the Edit Fields (Set) node. Set the Method to PATCH and use https://api.notion.com/v1/blocks/{{ $json.id }} as the URL value. Select Predefined Credential Type and connect your existing Notion credentials. Enable Send Body and set a parameter. Set the parameter Name to heading_1 (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using). Set the parameter Value to {{ $json.heading_1 }} (substitute heading_1 for the heading level you are using). The above sequence will create a regular heading block. It will query the newly created header, add the is_toggleable property, and update the heading block. Handle null and empty values # You may receive a validation error when working with the Notion node if you submit fields with empty or null values. This can occur any time you populate fields from previous nodes when that data is missing. To work around this, check for the existence of the field data before sending it to Notion or use a default value. To check for the data before executing the Notion node, use an If node to check whether the field is unset. This allows you to use the Edit Fields (Set) node to conditionally remove the field when it doesn't have a valid value. As an alternative, you can set a default value if the incoming data doesn't provide one. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Postgres node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Postgres node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Dynamically populate SQL IN groups with parameters # In Postgres, you can use the SQL IN comparison construct to make comparisons between groups of values: 1 SELECT color , shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ( 'small' , 'medium' , 'large' ); While you can use n8n expressions in your query to dynamically populate the values in an IN group, combining this with query parameters provides extra protection by automatically sanitizing input. To construct an IN group query with query parameters: Set the Operation to Execute Query . In Options , select Query Parameters . Use an expression to select an array from the input data. For example, {{ $json.input_shirt_sizes }} . In the Query parameter, write your query with the IN construct with an empty set of parentheses. For example: 1 SELECT color , shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN (); Inside of the IN parentheses, use an expression to dynamically create index-based placeholders (like $1 , $2 , and $3 ) for the number of items in your query parameter array. You can do this by increasing each array index by one since the placeholder variables are 1 indexed: 1 SELECT color , shirt_size FROM shirts WHERE shirt_size IN ( {{ $ json . input_shirt_sizes . map (( i , pos ) => "$" + ( pos + 1 )). join ( ', ' ) }} ); With this technique, n8n automatically creates the correct number of prepared statement placeholders for the IN values according to the number of items in your array. Working with timestamps and time zones # To avoid complications with how n8n and Postgres interpret timestamp and time zone data, follow these general tips: Use UTC when storing and passing dates : Using UTC helps avoid confusion over timezone conversions when converting dates between different representations and systems. Set the execution timezone : Set the global timezone in n8n using either environment variables (for self-hosted) or in the settings (for n8n Cloud). You can set a workflow-specific timezone in the workflow settings . Use ISO 8601 format : The ISO 8601 format encodes the day of the month, month, year, hour, minutes, and seconds in a standardized string. n8n passes dates between nodes as strings and uses Luxon to parse dates.

Telegram node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Telegram node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Add a bot to a Telegram channel # For a bot to send a message to a channel, you must add the bot to the channel. If you haven't added the bot to the channel, you'll see an error with a description like: Error: Forbidden: bot is not a participant of the channel . To add a bot to a channel: In the Telegram app, access the target channel and select the channel name. Label the channel name as public channel . Select Administrators > Add Admin . Search for the bot's username and select it. Select the checkmark on the top-right corner to add the bot to the channel. Get the Chat ID # You can only use @channelusername on public channels. To interact with a Telegram group, you need that group's Chat ID. There are three ways to get that ID: From the Telegram Trigger: Use the Telegram Trigger node in your workflow to get a Chat ID. This node can trigger on different events and returns a Chat ID on successful execution. From your web browser: Open Telegram in a web browser and open the group chat. The group's Chat ID is the series of digits behind the letter "g." Prefix your group Chat ID with a - when you enter it in n8n. Invite Telegram's @RawDataBot to the group: Once you add it, the bot outputs a JSON file that includes a chat object. The id for that object is the group Chat ID. Then remove the RawDataBot from your group. Send more than 30 messages per second # The Telegram API has a limitation of sending only 30 messages per second. Follow these steps to send more than 30 messages: Loop Over Items node : Use the Loop Over Items node to get at most 30 chat IDs from your database. Telegram node : Connect the Telegram node with the Loop Over Items node. Use the Expression Editor to select the Chat IDs from the Loop Over Items node. Code node : Connect the Code node with the Telegram node. Use the Code node to wait for a few seconds before fetching the next batch of chat IDs. Connect this node with the Loop Over Items node. You can also use this workflow . Remove the n8n attribution from sent messages # If you're using the node to send Telegram messages , the message automatically gets an n8n attribution appended to the end: This message was sent automatically with n8n To remove this attribution: In the node's Additional Fields section, select Add Field . Select Append n8n attribution . Turn the toggle off. Refer to Send Message additional fields for more information. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!

Google Sheets node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Sheets node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Append an array # To insert an array of data into Google Sheets, you must convert the array into a valid JSON (key, value) format. To do so, consider using: The Split Out node. The AI Transform node. For example, try entering something like: 1 Convert 'languages' array to JSON (key, value) pairs. The Code node . Column names were updated after the node's setup # You'll receive this error if the Google Sheet's column names have changed since you set up the node. To refresh the column names, re-select Mapping Column Mode . This should prompt the node to fetch the column names again. Once the column names refresh, update the node parameters.

Airtable node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Airtable node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials # This error displays when trying to perform actions not permitted by your current level of access. The full text looks something like this: 1 There was a problem loading the parameter options from server: "Forbidden - perhaps check your credentials?" The error most often displays when the credential you're using doesn't have the scopes it requires on the resources you're attempting to manage. Refer to the Airtable credentials and Airtables scopes documentation for more information. Service is receiving too many requests from you # Airtable has a hard API limit on the number of requests generated using personal access tokens. If you send more than five requests per second per base, you will receive a 429 error, indicating that you have sent too many requests. You will have to wait 30 seconds before resuming requests. This same limit applies for sending more than 50 requests across all bases per access token. You can find out more in the Airtable's rate limits documentation . If you find yourself running into rate limits with the Airtable node, consider implementing one of the suggestions on the handling rate limits page. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback!

Google Drive node common issues # Here are some common errors and issues with the Google Drive node and steps to resolve or troubleshoot them. Google hasn't verified this app # If using the OAuth authentication method, you might see the warning Google hasn't verified this app . To avoid this, you can create OAuth credentials from the same account you want to authenticate. If you need to use credentials generated by another account (by a developer or another third party), follow the instructions in Google Cloud documentation | Authorization errors: Google hasn't verified this app . Google Cloud app becoming unauthorized # For Google Cloud apps with Publishing status set to Testing and User type set to External , consent and tokens expire after seven days. Refer to Google Cloud Platform Console Help | Setting up your OAuth consent screen for more information. To resolve this, reconnect the app in the n8n credentials modal. Google Drive OAuth error # If using the OAuth authentication method, you may see an error indicating that you can't sign in because the app doesn't meet Google's expectations for keeping apps secure. Most often, the actual cause of this issue is that the URLs don't match between Google's OAuth configuration and n8n. To avoid this, start by reviewing any links included in Google's error message. This will contain details about the exact error that occurred. If you are self-hostin n8n, check the n8n configuration items used to construct external URLs. Verify that the N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL and WEBHOOK_URL environment variables use fully qualified domains. Get recent files from Google Drive # To retrieve recent files from Google Drive, you need to sort files by modification time. To do this, you need to search for existing files and retrieve their modification times. Next you can sort the files to find the most recent file and use another Google Drive node target the file by ID. The process looks like this: Add a Google Drive node to your canvas. Select the File/Folder resource and the Search operation. Enable Return All to sort through all files. Set the What to Search filter to Files . In the Options , set the Fields to All . Connect a Sort node to the output of the Google Drive node. Choose Simple sort type. Enter modifiedTime as the Field Name in the Fields To Sort By section. Choose Descending sort order. Add a Limit node to the output of the Sort node. Set Max Items to 1 to keep the most recent file. Connect another Google Drive node to the output of the Limit node.

About reformatting # The default JSON format for KoboToolbox submission data is sometimes hard to deal with, because it's not schema-aware, and all fields are therefore returned as strings. This node provides a lightweight opinionated reformatting logic, enabled with the Reformat? parameter, available on all operations that return form submissions: the submission query, get, and the attachment download operations. When enabled, the reformatting: Reorganizes the JSON into a multi-level hierarchy following the form's groups. By default, question grouping hierarchy is materialized by a / character in the field names, for example Group1/Question1 . With reformatting enabled, n8n reorganizes these into Group1.Question1 , as nested JSON objects. Renames fields to trim _ (not supported by many downstream systems). Parses all geospatial fields (Point, Line, and Area question types) into their standard GeoJSON equivalent. Splits all fields matching any of the Multiselect Mask wildcard masks into an array. Since the multi-select fields appear as space-separated strings, they can't be guessed algorithmically, so you must provide a field naming mask. Format the masks as a comma-separated list. Lists support the * wildcard. Converts all fields matching any of the Number Mask wildcard masks into a JSON float. Here's a detailed example in JSON: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 { "_id" : 471987 , "formhub/uuid" : "189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6" , "start" : "2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00" , "end" : "2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00" , "Field_Details/Field_Name" : "Test Fields" , "Field_Details/Field_Location" : "-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165" , "Field_Details/Field_Shape" : "-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165;-1.933011 30.078085 0 0;-1.933257 30.078004 0 0;-1.933338 30.078197 0 0;-1.933107 30.078299 0 0;-1.932914 30.078211 1421 165" , "Field_Details/Crops_Grown" : "maize beans avocado" , "Field_Details/Field_Size_sqm" : "2300" , "__version__" : "veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs" , "meta/instanceID" : "uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a" , "_xform_id_string" : "ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm" , "_uuid" : "2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a" , "_attachments" : [], "_status" : "submitted_via_web" , "_geolocation" : [ -1.932914 , 30.078211 ], "_submission_time" : "2021-12-05T14:15:44" , "_tags" : [], "_notes" : [], "_validation_status" : {}, "_submitted_by" : null } With reformatting enabled, and the appropriate masks for multi-select and number formatting (for example, Crops_* and *_sqm respectively), n8n parses it into: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 { "id" : 471987 , "formhub" : { "uuid" : "189436bb09a54957bfcc798e338b54d6" }, "start" : "2021-12-05T16:13:38.527+02:00" , "end" : "2021-12-05T16:15:33.407+02:00" , "Field_Details" : { "Field_Name" : "Test Fields" , "Field_Location" : { "lat" : -1.932914 , "lon" : 30.078211 }, "Field_Shape" : { "type" : "polygon" , "coordinates" : [ { "lat" : -1.932914 , "lon" : 30.078211 }, { "lat" : -1.933011 , "lon" : 30.078085 }, { "lat" : -1.933257 , "lon" : 30.078004 }, { "lat" : -1.933338 , "lon" : 30.078197 }, { "lat" : -1.933107 , "lon" : 30.078299 }, { "lat" : -1.932914 , "lon" : 30.078211 } ] }, "Crops_Grown" : [ "maize" , "beans" , "avocado" ], "Field_Size_sqm" : 2300 }, "version" : "veGcULpqP6JNFKRJbbMvMs" , "meta" : { "instanceID" : "uuid:2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a" }, "xform_id_string" : "ajXVJpBkTD5tB4Nu9QXpgm" , "uuid" : "2356cbbe-c1fd-414d-85c8-84f33e92618a" , "attachments" : [], "status" : "submitted_via_web" , "geolocation" : { "lat" : -1.932914 , "lon" : 30.078211 }, "submission_time" : "2021-12-05T14:15:44" , "tags" : [], "notes" : [], "validation_status" : {}, "submitted_by" : null } What to do if your operation isn't supported # If this node doesn't support the operation you want to do, you can use the HTTP Request node to call the service's API.

Map Automatically : Automatically map incoming data to matching column names in Postgres. The incoming data field names must match the column names in Postgres for this to work. If necessary, consider using the edit fields (set) node before this node to adjust the format as needed. Update options # Connection Timeout : The number of seconds to try to connect to the database. Delay Closing Idle Connection : The number of seconds to wait before considering idle connections eligible for closing. Query Batching : The way to send queries to the database: Single Query : A single query for all incoming items. Independently : Execute one query per incoming item of the execution. Transaction : Execute all queries in a transaction. If a failure occurs, Postgres rolls back all changes. Output Columns : Choose which columns to output. You can select from a list of available columns or specify IDs using expressions . Output Large-Format Numbers As : The format to output NUMERIC and BIGINT columns as: Numbers : Use this for standard numbers. Text : Use this if you expect numbers longer than 16 digits.

Templates and examples # Generate Instagram Content from Top Trends with AI Image Generation by mustafa kendigüzel View template details Chat with Postgresql Database by KumoHQ View template details HR & IT Helpdesk Chatbot with Audio Transcription by Felipe Braga View template details Browse Postgres integration templates , or search all templates Related resources # n8n provides a trigger node for Postgres. You can find the trigger node docs here . Use query parameters # When creating a query to run on a Postgres database, you can use the Query Parameters field in the Options section to load data into the query. n8n sanitizes data in query parameters, which prevents SQL injection. For example, you want to find a person by their email address. Given the following input data: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 [ { "email" : "alex@example.com" , "name" : "Alex" , "age" : 21 }, { "email" : "jamie@example.com" , "name" : "Jamie" , "age" : 33 } ] You can write a query like: 1 SELECT * FROM $ 1 : name WHERE email = $ 2 ; Then in Query Parameters , provide the field values to use. You can provide fixed values or expressions. For this example, use expressions so the node can pull the email address from each input item in turn: 1 2 // users is an example table name {{ [ 'users' , $json . email ] }} Common issues # For common questions or issues and suggested solutions, refer to Common issues .

Mapping Column Mode : Map Each Column Manually : Enter Values to Send for each column. Map Automatically : n8n looks for incoming data that matches the columns in Google Sheets automatically. In this mode, make sure the incoming data fields are the same as the columns in Google Sheets. (Use an Edit Fields node before this node to change them if required.) Nothing : Don't map any data. Options # Cell Format : Use this option to choose how to format the data in cells. Refer to Google Sheets API | CellFormat for more information. Let Google Sheets format (default): n8n formats text and numbers in the cells according to Google Sheets' default settings. Let n8n format : New cells in your sheet will have the same data types as the input data provided by n8n.

Set filters to return a limited set of results: Column : Select the column in your sheet to search against. Value : Enter a cell value to search for. You can drag input data parameters here. If your filter matches multiple rows, n8n returns the first result. If you want all matching rows: Under Options , select Add Option > When Filter Has Multiple Matches . Change When Filter Has Multiple Matches to Return All Matches . Options # Data Location on Sheet : Use this option to specify a data range. By default, n8n will detect the range automatically until the last row in the sheet. Output Formatting : Use this option to choose how n8n formats the data returned by Google Sheets. General Formatting : Values (unformatted) (default): n8n removes currency signs and other special formatting. Data type remains as number. Values (formatted) : n8n displays the values as they appear in Google Sheets (for example, retaining commas or currency signs) by converting the data type from number to string. Formulas : n8n returns the formula. It doesn't calculate the formula output. For example, if a cell B2 has the formula =A2 , n8n returns B2's value as =A2 (in text). Refer to About date & time values | Google Sheets for more information. Date Formatting : Refer to DateTimeRenderOption | Google Sheets for more information. - Formatted Text (default): As displayed in Google Sheets, which depends on the spreadsheet locale. For example 01/01/2024 . - Serial Number : Number of days since December 30th 1899. When Filter Has Multiple Matches : Set to Return All Matches to get multiple matches. By default only the first result gets returned. First row n8n treats the first row in a Google Sheet as a heading row, and doesn't return it when reading all rows. If you want to read the first row, use the Options to set Data Location on Sheet . Refer to the Method: spreadsheets.batchUpdate | Google Sheets API documentation for more information.

OpenAI Text operations # Use this operation to message a model or classify text for violations in OpenAI. Refer to OpenAI for more information on the OpenAI node itself. Message a Model # Use this operation to send a message or prompt to an OpenAI model and receive a response. Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with : Create or select an existing OpenAI credential . Resource : Select Text . Operation : Select Message a Model . Model : Select the model you want to use. If you’re not sure which model to use, try gpt-4o if you need high intelligence or gpt-4o-mini if you need the fastest speed and lowest cost. Refer to Models overview | OpenAI Platform for more information. Messages : Enter a Text prompt and assign a Role that the model will use to generate responses. Refer to Prompt engineering | OpenAI for more information on how to write a better prompt by using these roles. Choose from one of these roles: User : Sends a message as a user and gets a response from the model. Assistant : Tells the model to adopt a specific tone or personality. System : By default, the system message is "You are a helpful assistant" . You can define instructions in the user message, but the instructions set in the system message are more effective. You can only set one system message per conversation. Use this to set the model's behavior or context for the next user message. Simplify Output : Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. Output Content as JSON : Turn on to attempt to return the response in JSON format. Compatible with GPT-4 Turbo and all GPT-3.5 Turbo models newer than gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 . Options # Frequency Penalty : Apply a penalty to reduce the model's tendency to repeat similar lines. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0 . Maximum Number of Tokens : Set the maximum number of tokens for the response. One token is roughly four characters for standard English text. Use this to limit the length of the output. Number of Completions : Defaults to 1. Set the number of completions you want to generate for each prompt. Use carefully since setting a high number will quickly consume your tokens. Presence Penalty : Apply a penalty to influence the model to discuss new topics. The range is between 0.0 and 2.0 . Output Randomness (Temperature) : Adjust the randomness of the response. The range is between 0.0 (deterministic) and 1.0 (maximum randomness). We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Top P) but not both. Start with a medium temperature (around 0.7 ) and adjust based on the outputs you observe. If the responses are too repetitive or rigid, increase the temperature. If they’re too chaotic or off-track, decrease it. Defaults to 1.0 . Output Randomness (Top P) : Adjust the Top P setting to control the diversity of the assistant's responses. For example, 0.5 means half of all likelihood-weighted options are considered. We recommend altering this or Output Randomness (Temperature) but not both. Defaults to 1.0 . Refer to Message a Model | OpenAI documentation for more information. Classify Text for Violations # Use this operation to identify and flag content that might be harmful. OpenAI model will analyze the text and return a response containing: flagged : A boolean field indicating if the content is potentially harmful. categories : A list of category-specific violation flags. category_scores : Scores for each category. Enter these parameters: Credential to connect with : Create or select an existing OpenAI credential . Resource : Select Text . Operation : Select Classify Text for Violations . Text Input : Enter text to classify if it violates the moderation policy. Simplify Output : Turn on to return a simplified version of the response instead of the raw data. Options # Use Stable Model : Turn on to use the stable version of the model instead of the latest version, accuracy may be slightly lower. Refer to Moderations | OpenAI documentation for more information. Common issues # For common errors or issues and suggested resolution steps, refer to Common Issues . Was this page helpful?
