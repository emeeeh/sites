Data filtering # Feature availability Available on Cloud Pro and Enterprise plans. Search and filter data in the node INPUT and OUTPUT panels. Use this to check your node's data. To search: In a node, select Search in the INPUT or OUTPUT panel. Enter your search term. n8n filters as you type your search, displaying the objects or rows containing the term. Filtering is purely visual: n8n doesn't change or delete data. The filter resets when you close and reopen the node. Was this page helpful? Thanks for your feedback! Thanks for your feedback!
