Manage variables # n8n doesn't sync variable values with Git. You must set up the credentials manually when setting up a new instance. You can choose to set up variables manually, or using the API . Manage variables using the API # n8n syncs variable names, but doesn't push variable values to your Git provider. You can either: Manually set variable values in n8n. Set variable values using the n8n API, using the /pull endpoint. Managing variables using the API has several advantages: You can automatically update variable values using a CI (continuous integration) tool. You may also be able to protect the values. For example, you can store values in GitHub secrets , then populate the variables in n8n using an API call from a GitHub Action . To manage variables using an API call, make a POST request to /source-control/pull : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 curl --location '<YOUR-INSTANCE-URL>/api/v1/source-control/pull' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --header 'X-N8N-API-KEY: <YOUR-API-KEY>' \ --data '{ "force": true, "variables": { "key1": "value1", "key2": "value2" } } ' If the key already exists in n8n, the API call updates the value. If there is no variable with the key, it creates a new variable. After setting values using the API, you can safely edit variables in n8n, and push and pull changes. Was this page helpful?
